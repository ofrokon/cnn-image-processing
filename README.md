# Convolutional Neural Networks: Revolutionizing Image Processing with PyTorch

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating the architecture and implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks using PyTorch. It accompanies the Medium post "Convolutional Neural Networks: Revolutionizing Image Processing with PyTorch".

6. [License](#license)

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need Python 3.6 or later. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ofrokon/cnn-image-processing-pytorch.git
   cd cnn-image-processing-pytorch
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To generate all visualizations and train the CNN model, run:

```
python cnn_visualizations_pytorch.py
```

This will create PNG files for visualizations and print training progress in the console.

## Visualizations

This script generates the following visualizations:

1. `conv_layer_visualization.png`: Output of a convolutional layer
2. `pooling_layer_visualization.png`: Effect of max pooling on an image
3. `training_history.png`: Training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs
4. `conv1_activations.png`: Activations of the first convolutional layer

## Topics Covered

1. CNN Architecture
   - Convolutional Layers
   - Pooling Layers
   - Fully Connected Layers
2. Building a CNN with PyTorch
3. Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models
4. Visualizing CNN Activations

Each topic is explained in detail in the accompanying Medium post, including Python implementation and visualizations.
